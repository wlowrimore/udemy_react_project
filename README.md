# Expense Tracker
ReactJS | Vanilla CSS | ES6

## Description
This is a project I completed through the Udemy React Course.  It is a ReactJS project that is fully functional, other than the hard-coded expense data found in an array.  You may still add data, however it will not be saved to a database.  This project utilizes the 2-way binding method, and passes props both ways.  The file tree is packed with smaller components for ease of navigation in the code editor.  Although I perfer to use TailwindCSS as my styling framework, theis course module expected that I use Vanilla CSS.  Each component has it's own CSS file with conventional naming for an easy to follow experience.  This is the first of a few projects required for completion of this course.
